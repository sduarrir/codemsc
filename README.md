# codemsc
Specific code used for my master's thesis: Genomic insights into Merchero population

- Scripts folder : bash/python simple scripts to automathizase some tasks
- Pipelines folder : commands used to do the different analyses. These files are not meant to be executed as bash scripts
- R notebooks: analyses/plotting developed in R

Compared to the thesis some extra analyses can be found, most of them to check that the datasets were properly imported, or that there was no mistake in any previous step.
